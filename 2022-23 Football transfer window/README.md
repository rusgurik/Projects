## Project title: 2022-23 Football transfer window
What we’ll do?

This notebook is a very basic and simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) for main transfers to top leagues in the current summer transfer window, some teams investing a lot of money to be at the top for the upcoming season.

First of all, we need to scrap the data from transfermarket.com and then let's answer some questions by using different graphs and charts (Plotly):

- Which league invested the most this summer?
- What positions of the players were most expensive to the top leagues?
- Which team spent/earned the most?
- Who is the most underpaid/overpaid player?
